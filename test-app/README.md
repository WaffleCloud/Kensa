    Testing Application to Demo Performance Monitoring Tool
</p>

## Features

### Backend only application

An application built using GraphQL is necessary in order to test queries on using the playground. This application was built with the intetion to make it easy to test the monitoring tool before connecting your own application. The idea is to have an application that will mimic the behaviour of a fullstack application built with GraphQL as the server-side runtime for the application programming interface.


## Getting Started

To test queries and get detailed metrics for the test GraphQL application, follow these easy steps.
